# Sentiment_Analysis
This is a collaboration project between me and a fellow Beta Microsoft Laern Student Ambassador.
It involves analyzing the sentiments of Tweets scraped from Twitter using snscraper library and visualizing on Power BI
The tweets are based on the Nigeria 2023 forthcoming election. The top 3 presidential candidates were analyzed to see the most popular on Twitter alongside their parties.
Note: This project is not for the prediction of the Nigeria 2023 president
This project is documented on the Microsft Educators Blog
